# Problem Statement

## ðŸ©º AI-Powered Diagnostic Chatbot for Rural Healthcare Accessibility

In rural areas, timely access to healthcare is often limited, which impacts the quality of medical interventions. Design an accessible, AI-driven chatbot platform (voice or text-based) that interacts with users to assess basic health symptoms, categorizes potential health issues, generates detailed preliminary diagnostic reports, and provides referrals to qualified medical practitioners in nearby urban centers.
